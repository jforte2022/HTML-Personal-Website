# HTMLprojectWebsite
This was my final project for my HTML class. We were tasked with creating a website using HTML and CSS (style sheets). I created a fake resume, included a hobbies/interests page, and several other pages. I also uploaded the site to the Internet. It can be accessed here: http://forte636.myweb.usf.edu/
